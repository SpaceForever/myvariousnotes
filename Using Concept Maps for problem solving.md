# Using Concept Maps for problem solving

Concept Maps are an expectionally powerful [[Tools for Thinking]], as well as [[Using silence for problem solving]]. They show the relationship between thoughts and can be used to notice and reprogram unhelpful thought loops. All you need is paper and a pen.

Often when I feel bad about something, I will draw what is the likely trigger and put it in a box, and then on the otherside of the paper I will put [I feel bad] in  a box, then try to draw a path between them of activated concepts to explain why I feel bad. 

The most revealing aspect of concept maps is the all too common link of [X thinks y about me] -> [I should feel y about me]. This is the cause of embarrasment. It is freeing to realise this conncetion because, of course (as described in the stages of development) it is totally possible to form an opion of yourself separate from your environment's (and it's good!).
